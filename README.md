**Display:**

The resolution is not less than 1920 at 1080, the refresh rate of the screen is not less than 60 Hz.




**Sensors:**

- Rotational sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer);

- 2 cameras (hmd positioning and controllers in space);

- Proximity sensor (automatic transition to sleep mode).




**Connectors:**

- 3.5 mm audio jack for optional headphones;

- HDMI or Display port;

- MiniUSB connector for powering the HMD and optional controllers;

- Two USB 2.0 outputs for optional controllers;




**Interaction:**

- On / off button;

- Brightness adjustment dial (bright game places, bright games);




**Communication modules:**

- Bluetooth 4.0 (integrated in the HMD). Required when using controllers in wireless mode;




**Connection:**

The connection is via a Y-cable HDMI + USB cable or two conventional cables. All connectors are located at the top of the HMD.





**Working modes:**

HMD can work in modes:

- Advanced mode (normal second display);

- Direct mode;

There are also software modes:

- Mirror (the image of the primary display, necessary for running old incompatible games in 3D mode);

- VR mirror (primary display image adapted for VR viewing);



## Controllers

**Sensors:**

- Rotational sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer);




**Connectors:**

- The miniUSB connector for working in the wired controller mode.




**Buttons:**

Trigger, Grip, A, B, Menu, System and Stick.




**Communication modules:**

- Bluetooth 4.0 for wireless operation;




**Power supply:**

Power can occur in two modes:

- Powered by 2 AA batteries;

- Power supply from the HMD;




**Interaction:**

Turning the controller on and off is done by pressing the "System" button for 3 seconds. In the on mode, on the controller, a blue indicator is visible.
